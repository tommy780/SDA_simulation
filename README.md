# SDA_simulation
simulation code for Strand Displacement Amplification reaction.
The kinetic parameters were obtained via the codes in python 3.6 (fit.py).
And the kinetic parameters were applied in the matlab code for simulation of SDA_SFT.m and detect.m.
The detection.csv was the raw data for the fittness in python.
